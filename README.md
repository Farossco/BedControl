# Lumos

This is a personnal project to create a fully automated alarm clock.

This would wake you up using a smooth light that can also be completed with sound.

This project is composed of 2 main components which are :

* An ESP32
* An Web Application (Running inside the ESP32)

This branch is dedicated to (try to) porting the project to the Rust language. This basically means redo everything from scratch and make it an opportunity to learn a new language. Let's have fun.

This is also an opportunity to remake the web applications with more up-to-date technologies as frameworks like 'React' or 'Vue' (Might be too ambitious with Rust though)
