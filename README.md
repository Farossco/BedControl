# BedControl

This is a personnal project to create a fully automated alarm clock.

This would wake you up using a smooth light that can also be completed with sound.

This project is composed of 3 main components which are :

* An Arduino MEGA
* An ESP8266
* An Android Application

Each of these components has it's own piece of code in their own branch. This is why the master branch is empty.
