# Lumos

This is a personnal project to create a fully automated alarm clock.

This would wake you up using a smooth light that can also be completed with sound.

This project is composed of 3 main components which are :

* An Arduino MEGA
* An ESP8266
* An Android Application

The application is made using `Visual Studio Code` with the `PlatformIO` plugin. You can use an IDE other than `Visual Studio Code` but `PlatformIO` is needed.

You will probably need to change the `upload_port` and `monitor_port` entries in the `platformio.ini` file.

Compiling this project with PlatformIO will give you the 2 binary files.
